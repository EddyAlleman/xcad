xCAD.NET is a framework which is designed to simplify development of software for SOLIDWORKS in .NET (C# and VB.NET).

Framework provides utilities for implementation software design principles such as [S.O.L.I.D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), [type safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety), **single point of maintenance** for developing maintainable and scalable solutions for SOLIDWORKS and other CAD systems.

There are 3 main section of CAD functionality which are covered by framework

* [Extensions](extensions) - add-in skeleton, commands, menus, toolbars, events management, data access
* [Property Pages](property-pages) - building native property pages with data binding
* [Custom Feature](custom-features) - building parametric native features
